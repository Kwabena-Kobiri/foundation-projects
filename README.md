# foundation-projects
This repository holds various foundation projects from (programming) languages that I am studying.
Foundation projects are basically the type of projects that a beginner or an intermediate in a particlar 
(programming) language would undertake.
To be able to run the "js_framework_website", install the node modules in the file directory by using npm i or npm install.
